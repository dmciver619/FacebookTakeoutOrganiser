# FacebookTakeoutOrganiser

C# program that I created to organise files downloaded using Facebook's download your information (dyi) files.
This program accepts the JSON version of the downloaded files

The output is a folder broken down by years then each file is named according to the date received with "(Facebook)" appended to the end
